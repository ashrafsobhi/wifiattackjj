# **App Name**: Web Wireless Auditor

## Core Features:

- Wifi Interface Check: Simulate the `iwconfig` command to display available wireless interfaces and their status in the emulated environment.
- Monitor Mode Activation: Emulate `airmon-ng start wlan0` to enable monitor mode on a selected wireless interface. Create a virtual interface (e.g., `wlan0mon`) for monitoring.
- Network Scanning: Implement the functionality of `airodump-ng` to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks. Display network information such as BSSID, PWR, CH, ESSID in a tabular format.
- Handshake Capture Simulation: Simulate the capture of a WPA handshake by focusing on a target network (BSSID and channel). Indicate when a WPA handshake is virtually captured in the simulation.
- Handshake Conversion Tool: Use an AI tool to indicate that `hcxpcapngtool` (or an emulated substitute) is used to convert the captured handshake into a format suitable for Hashcat.
- Password Cracking Emulation: Simulate the process of cracking the WPA handshake using Hashcat. Users can input a mask (e.g., `?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d`) to define the password pattern and start the cracking simulation using AI reasoning capabilities as a tool.
- Result Display: Present the result of the cracking attempt, indicating whether the password was cracked successfully. If cracked, display the cracked password.  If not, show status and encourage user to alter settings or keep the tool active for a longer time

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF) to evoke a sense of technology.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F2E7FF). It maintains the association with the primary color.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#8F00FF), with somewhat greater saturation, provides clear contrast against the background, and nicely aligns with the purple theme.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, for headlines and UI labels. If any longer text needs to be rendered, pair with 'Inter' for the body font.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospace, to display any code or commands related to the process.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different stages of the penetration testing process (scanning, capturing, cracking).
- Design the interface to mimic a command-line interface (CLI) environment. Organize output into well-formatted tables. Clearly present ongoing feedback and updates.
